selection sort 概念：
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that treats the input as two parts,
a sorted part and an unsorted part, and repeatedly selects the proper next
value to move from the unsorted part to the end of the sorted part.

SelectionSortDemo:
    1> 算法：selection sort
        > nested 双 loop
        > 三行，三值swap
        > 不同for loop，toString, 一行显示Array全部内容
        > pass array variable in method
        > declare and initialize array

        > static VS void method, 一个return值， 一个不return
        > call含array parameter的method


SelectionSortDemo1:
This program uses the selection sort algorithm to sort an array.
The code has been modified to also calculate how many item comparisons
are done. You can try running the program with different arrays to see
how the total number of comparisons changes (or doesn't change).
