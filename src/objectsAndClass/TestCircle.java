// This is a program that defines the Circle class and uses it to create objects. The pro- gram constructs three circle
// objects with radius 1, 25, and 125 and displays the radius and area of each of the three circles. It then changes the
// radius of the second object to 100 and displays its new radius and area.

//The program contains two classes. The first of these, TestCircle, is the main class. Its sole purpose is to test the
// second class, Circle. Such a program that uses the class is often referred to as a client of the class. When you run
// the program, the Java runtime system invokes the main method in the main class.

// You can put the two classes into one file, but only one class in the file can be a public class. Furthermore, the
// public class must have the same name as the file name. Therefore, the file name is TestCircle.java, since TestCircle
// is public.
