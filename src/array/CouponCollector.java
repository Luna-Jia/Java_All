// (Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics problem with many practical
// applications. The problem is to repeatedly pick objects from a set of objects and find out how many picks are
// needed for all the objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from a
// shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly, and find out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit.
// Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before picking another. Write a program to simulate the
// number of picks needed to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a
// card may be picked twice).
