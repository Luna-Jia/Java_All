// The linear search approach compares the key element key sequentially with each element in the array. It continues to
// do so until the key matches an element in the array, or the array is exhausted without a match being found. If a
// match is made, the linear search returns the index of the element in the array that matches the key. If no match is
// found, the search returns âˆ’1.

// The linear search method compares the key with each element in the array. The elements can be in any order. On
// average, the algorithm will have to examine half of the elements in an array before finding the key, if it exists.
// Since the execution time of a linear search increases linearly as the number of array elements increases, linear
// search is inefficient for a large array.
